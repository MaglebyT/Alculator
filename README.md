simple calculator for ABV to get an accurate estimate for alcohol consumption (USA standards) 

It can be tricky to estimate how much alcohol you are really drinking with so much vairation in container size and ABV (% alcohol).
The purpose of this app allows the user to 'lock in' how much alcohol the user wants to limit themselves to in the form of "points", 
and tally up how much they are really consuming (Example 1 standard drink contains .6 oz of pure alcohol, 
however a 12oz light beer at 4.2% contains roughly .5oz, and a 12oz IPA of 6.2% contains .74 oz, etc.)

V2 will allow custom fields for more granular estimation.
